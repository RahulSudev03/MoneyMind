# MoneyMind
We focused on making a project that uses artificial intelligence to provide customized recommendations to individuals to improve the strength of their financial portfolio.

## Inspiration
We were inspired by our passion for money and teaching others about the value of financial independence so that they can best route themselves for success in the long run.

## What it does
The product that we designed is a web application which allows users to sign into their account (Google) and then access general information about how to improve their stock portfolio, or catered to customer insights if a personal stock portfolio is provided.

## How we built it
We built the product by leveraging the power of unique API's that we were granted access through during the hackathon, calling upon the creative talents of ChatGPT, and writing code to fortify the front-end or back-end using Visual Studio as a whole.

## Challenges we ran into
Integrating Hume's API served as a challenge to us because we realized that there wasn't a drastic distinguishable differentiation that could be observed when looking at the different sentiments to the news. However to correct this, we figured out that assigning an appropriate weight in a reasonable ballpark for the emotion could be effective in separating the severity of the feelings entirely.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have gotten familiar with the API's in such a short time and to have understood how to utilize them in a way to make for a compelling use that can aid the general public as an educational resource.

## What we learned
We learned that sometimes we don't have to go off the baseline provided technologies and that there is often room to experiment or creatively manipulate the technologies in order to suit the functionalities that we are aiming for altogether.

## What's next for MoneyMind
We hope to add more API implementations that can better predict the direction that the stocks are trending towards and thereby increase the accuracy of the specific recommendations offered to the users with financial portfolios.
